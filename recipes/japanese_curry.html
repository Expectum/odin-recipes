    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Japanese curry is different from Indian or Thai curries. It is more of a brown stew and it can be mild or spicy, depending on your tastes. The curry roux, from no heat to very spicy, can be bought at any international grocery store. It can be served over white rice or with udon noodles. This recipe is very flexible; it can easily be made for more or less people. It can also be frozen (don't put the potatoes in).</p>
